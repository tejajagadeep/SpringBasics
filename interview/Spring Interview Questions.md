1. What is the Spring framework, and why is it used?

Answer: Spring is a comprehensive framework for Java development that provides a wide range of features for building enterprise applications. It simplifies the development of Java applications by promoting good design principles, such as dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming. Spring is used to address the complexity of enterprise application development, making it more modular, scalable, and maintainable.

2. Explain the concept of Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring.

Answer: Dependency Injection is a design pattern in which the objects are given their dependencies rather than creating them. In Spring, DI is achieved through Inversion of Control (IoC) containers. The container manages the objects of the application, including their lifecycle and configuration. Spring injects the dependencies through constructors, setters, or fields, reducing the tight coupling between components.

3. What are the different modules in the Spring framework?

iv. Web: Facilitates the development of web applications.
v. MVC (Model-View-Controller): Provides a web module based on the MVC design pattern.

4. Explain the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext.

Answer: Both BeanFactory and ApplicationContext are containers in Spring. BeanFactory is the simplest container, providing basic features such as dependency injection.
